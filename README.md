# -CHATBOT-WITH-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS
This project is a machine learning–powered chatbot that not only responds to user inputs but also detects sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) behind every message. It combines NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques with a rule-based or ML-based chatbot system, making conversations more human-like and emotionally aware.
